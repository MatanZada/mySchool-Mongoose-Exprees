with mongoose create 2 models - student, grades
Student needs to have name:string, grade:number, age:number
all of those fields are required (mongoose validation)
Grade needs to have student_id: string, grade: number

Add route for adding a new students to the DB (app.get)

Add a route that show our top grade. `fetch`

To the public folder add `index.html`,

Add a readme.md file to your project and explain to the next developer all the commands and depencies you installed and what it does.
Add to it each response from the preview from the network tab.

Bonus: (this is the same bonus from before, none of you did it so im adding it again :) )
Create a middlewere that write down each incomming request to the server in a json file (each request as a json object)
Hint(app.use())

Good luck
